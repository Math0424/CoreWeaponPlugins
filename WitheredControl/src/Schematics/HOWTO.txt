how to make the scem file

1. build a structure that you want to use !!see fig1 for how to orientate it!!

<fig1/>.

	top down view
	_________
    |       |		 .
    |		|		/ \
    |		|		 |
    |___f___|   	 |
    c		   	   south
    
    key:
    c = were the chest will go (can be anywere accept on the structure)
    f = front
    
    (note: Withered plugin will mirror the structure eastwards build accordingly thats just how the code works)
</fig1>.   
 
2. once you build the structure with the above format you select it in worldedit 1.13 go to were you want the chest and type //copy

3. then you type //schem save [name]

4. navigate to your worldedit folder and into schematics

5. take your file that you created and move it to Withered/Schematics

6. go to the loot config and look at the stucture format to add it to the loot table

7. then type /withered give structures and look for yours!

if errors occour while placing the chest you probably did something wrong...
